# Guess-Number-Game

This game consists of guessing a random number between 1 and 50 which was set up by the system.

Initially, the system checks whether the user has entered a valid number between 1 and 50. 

The system will display the following message to the user if the number is higher than 50: "Please enter a number between 1 and 50.".

To help the users guess the number, there are four types of return messages.

1. "It's too low".
2. "Your number is low".
3. "Your number is high".
4. "It's too high".

The game will display the number of times users have tried.

The user has 10 chances to guess the guessing number.
